## Favicon_Checker.py

This is a random thing I made that compares favicons to websites scanned to known favicons from the [OWASP list](https://wiki.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_favicon_database). This is helpeful when trying to discover what framework a web app is based on a default favicon.

Can be run via `python3 favicon_checker.py [url]`
